# Training Project: calculator
This is a calculator
It is supposed to take commands on the form of `awesomecalculator add 3 5` <br/>
and the output would be `8` <br/>
so `argv[1]` is the operation. ex. add, subtract, multiply, divide, absolute, negate, power, root, log, ln, factorial, sin, cos and tan.<br/>
`argv[2]` and `argv[3]` are the operands.<br/>
everyone can implement one operation function.<br/>
and someone will implement the main function body.<br/>
if all functions were already implemented, come up with a new one and make it :D
