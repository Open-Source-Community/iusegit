# Cheatsheet for everyday life with git
This sheet assumes you have basic knowledge of git. It merely serves as a refresher. 

## All Git commands in one file: [HERE](https://doabledanny.gumroad.com/l/git-commands-cheat-sheet-pdf)

## Clone or initialize a new git repo
* `git clone <url>` clones an existing repo from given url.
* `git init` creates a new repo in the current directory

## Basic workflow (add, commit, pull and push)
These are 85% of the commands you'll use
* you make changes
* `git add .` to add everything
* `git commit -m "<insert meaningful commit message here>"` to commit your changes
* `git pull` to get latest changes
* `git push` to push your changes

**Note:** The first time you push type `git push origin master -u` the `-u` tells git that `origin` and `master` are the default remote and branch respectively.

* `git push <remote name> <branch name>` To push to a certain remote and branch. Usually `git push origin master`.
* `git pull <remote name> <branch name>` Same as above except that it's pulling this time. Usually `git pull origin master`.

## Branches
* `git branch` lists available branches
* `git branch <branch name>` creates a new branch
* `git checkout <branch name>` moves to the specified branch
* `git checkout -b <branch name>` creates a new branch and moves to it (it's a shortcut for the previous two commands)
* `git merge <branch name>` merges <branch name> with current branch
* `git branch -d <branch name>` deletes branch if already merged to master
* `git branch -D <branch name>` deletes branch by force even if not merged to master

## Remotes
Your local repo can be connected to multiple remote repositories at once. Example: github, bitbucket and the local staging server in company. If you're connected to more than one remote this will probably help you.
* `git remote -v` lists the remote names and urls
* `git remote add <remote name> <url>` Adds a new remote
* `git remote set-url <remote name> <new url>` Changes remote url
* `git remote rm <remote name>` Removes remote

## Undoing Changes
Use these to when you mess things up and want to revert back to a previous commit. Be careful **Try you best not to change history** unless absolutely necessary. Checkout the beautiful [Atlasian documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes) for more details.
* `git revert <commit id>` Produces a new commit that undoes everything that was done in the provided commit. It's a safe way to undo changes without changing commit history.
* `git reset --hard` removes all the changes you made and reverts you back to the last commit. You cannot undo this.
* `git reset --hard <commit id>` removes all the changes you made and reverts you back to the commit you stated. **Do not do this unless absolutely necessary** This will cause you so much pain if you're working with a team.
* `git reset <commit id>` This is called a soft reset. Do it to revert back to a certain commit but keeping the changes unstaged (ready to be added and committed).

## Other useful stuff
* `git fetch` fetches all remote changes, tags and branches without merging with the current branch.
I usually use this to grab all remote branches and then merge one of them to master.
